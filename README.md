Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal API Demo

Abstract:
The Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal (HCDP) (available https://www.hawaii.edu/climate-data-portal/data-portal/) provides access to 30+ years of climatological data collected from sensor stations around the state of Hawaiʻi and gridded data products derived from these values. The HCDP is a publicly available web application and is backed by an API that is accessible to researchers on request. This notebook demonstrates some of the abilities and usage of the HCDP API and the data provided by it. The notebook will show the user how to retrieve and map sensor station metadata and values, retrieve gridded data products, produce timeseries of station and gridded data, and generate data packages for large amounts of data that can be downloaded directly or sent to the user’s email.

Instructions:
In cell 3 replace the hcdp_api_token and email variable values. An HCDP API token can be found in the abstract in EasyChair. Please note this token is not included in this repository. The email variable should be set to your email address. Once these values are set you should be able to execute the notebook sequentially as normal.
